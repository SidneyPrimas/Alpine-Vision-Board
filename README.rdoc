# Alpine Vision Board

I built this web app as a side project to help people (especially myself) achieve their goals through social accountability. At Duke, I was part of a community that consistently motivated each other achieve their goals. After graduation, I wanted to bring parts of this supportive environment with me. Alpine is the result. The app allowed a user to create goals, add specific friends to each goal to help them stay accountable, and update  progress towards achieving these goals. 

To build the system, I used Ruby with Sinatra on the backend, integrated with Facebooks' social graph and hosted the app on Heroku.
